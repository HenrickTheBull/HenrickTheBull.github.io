<h1>About Bryant</h1>
<p>After graduating from high school, Bryant went on to work for six years before opening his own company.
His company repaired computers for many people over the years, but since the business is no longer viable with the disposable nature of computers, Bryant turned to programming and live streaming.

With only basic programming knowladge in Python and some experince with HTML and CSS Bryant turned to Thinkful's coding boot camp to give him the skills he needs.</p>
