    <!--Intro-->
    
  <h1>Hello, I'm Bryant</h1>
  



  <p>I'm a software developer living in Washington Parish, Louisiana</p>
  <p>As a web developer and live streamer, I love to build designs that incorporate many elements.</p>
   
  <ul>
    <li>Designs to dazzle the senses and show off what you do.</li>
    <li>Quality code that's worth showing off.</li>
    <li>I enjoy working with other developers to broaden my own skills.</li>
   </ul>
  
  <p>Please take a look around and feel free to <a href="#contact">Contact Me.</a></p>

<!--About Section. I hate writing about myself in first person. Call it a self-confidence issue.-->
<h2>About Bryant</h2>
<p>After graduating from high school, I went on to work for six years before opening my own company.</p>

<p>My company repaired computers for many people over the years, but since the business is no longer viable with the disposable nature of computers, I've turned to programming and live streaming to make an income.</p>

<p>With only basic programming knowledge in Python and some experience with HTML and CSS I turned to Thinkful's coding boot camp to give me the skills I need.</p>
